However, this wonderful destination retains an authenticity which has been somewhat lessened in nearby My Tho.  This picturesque and friendly Mekong Delta town has historically seen very few travelers, but the recent opening of a bridge connecting Ben Tre and My Tho has made it far easier for day trippers to visit from Saigon.  Our one day cruise excursion starts at 8:00 am from the lobby of your hotel in Saigon with a drive to Ben Tre. While there, you can take a walk along the waterfront, lined with French era shops and houses, and you'll see plenty of coconuts being unloaded from boats for dispatch around the country. Then, jump on a boat for a couple of hours of cruising on the Mekong River. You will enjoy your delicious lunch at a local restaurant or on board. The excursion will end at around 4:00pm where the vehicle will await you for your transfer back to Saigon. Overnight in Ho Chi Minh "

As you won’t be spending much time in Ho Chi Minh City, we recommend arriving a few days early to see more of this fascinating city. See the ancient pagodas and cathedrals near the former Presidential Palace, historic Dong Khoi Street, and the chaotic markets of Ben Thanh and Cholon (Chinatown). Better yet, consider taking a day trip such as Urban Adventure’s Cu Chi Experience.

This fertile area is famous for its abundance of fruit, flower and rice crops, and is known as the ‘rice bowl’ of Vietnam. During your boat ride you’ll visit some cottage industries along the river before heading to your guesthouse.

If you haven’t already, head to Ben Thanh Market for some delicious street food, colourful shopping and even more colourful characters. This evening, board an overnight train bound for Danang.

In the afternoon, swap walking for cycling with a bike ride through the countryside near Hoi An. There's no better way to explore the peaceful area than on two wheels.

Hoi An is also known for its great food, so you could book yourself in for a cooking class to take some culinary secrets away with you.

Once in Hue, you’ll have a free afternoon to explore. Hue was once Vietnam’s imperial capital and has a curious mix of bustling streets and tranquil enclaves. Perhaps visit the Dong Ba Market, which sells everything imaginable and is a great place to spend some time. It’s important to know that Hue is renowned for its cuisine, with some delicious dishes originating from this region, including bun bo hue (Hue’s delicious take on pho), and banh khoai (a filled turmeric crepe).

Here you’ll see an active Buddhist monastery dating back to 1601 and a car belonging to the monk who tragically set himself alight in public to protest against the treatment of Buddhists. You may also like to visit one of the royal tombs, that of Emperor Tu Duc, with its central lake set amid a grove of frangipani and pine trees.

Continue on to the Dong Xuan Market and Hoan Kiem Lake, making sure you check out the unique architecture along the way. Hanoi has a French provincial feel left over from colonial times, but it also has a Buddhist influence and striking modern buildings. The rest of the day is yours to explore Hanoi as you please.

About 150 kilometres from the famous Vietnamese bay is another equally as impressive landscape. This one, known as Trang An, is nowhere near the coast though, and the mountains are connected by rice paddies, not water. After enjoying a delicious lunch, we will take a boat up the beautiful river fed by natural springs, through caves that bisect amaoldPrice limestone karst mountains to visit an Ancient 10th Century pagoda and temple.  After our visit to the Pagoda and Temple, it’ll be great fun to hop on a bike for a trip to Thung Nham Bird Garden. The route to the garden is a quiet one, consisting of flat roads and dams set to a back of stunning scenery. In total the round-trip is roughly 10 kilometres long.  After all this activity you might feel a bit damp, so we’ll take you back to the hotel where you can enjoy a shower and get cleaned up, before boarding the overnight train to Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park.

Our first stop is Eight Lady Cave which is named for the eight women working on the Route 20 highway who died from a bomb attack that caused a massive rock to seal off the exit, trapping them inside. Then we move on to Paradise Cave, one of the most beautiful and famous caves in Phong Nha stretching for more than 30 kilometres and featuring hundreds of incredible rock formations.  After lunch we visit the awesome Dark Cave by zip line or kayaks for the slightly less adventurous. With only a head torch to light our way, we will navigate through the darkness to the mud baths where you can either relax and soak up goodness, leaving you with baby smooth skin, or have some fun with a classic mud fight!

The structure and its majestic architecture, built by Gia Long, sadly suffered extensive damage during the years of fierce conflict which took place here. These scars provide an extra layer of history, telling a tale of the decades of fighting long past.  We will continue your trip into the past by visiting Minh Mang Tomb, the final resting place of the 2nd emperor of Vietnam. This tomb is special in the way its architecture blends seamlessly with its surrounding landscape (a result of Minh Mang’s staunch belief in Confucianism). Following this, you can hop back on the bus and we’ll take you to the local beach to enjoy some lunch and cocktails as we swim and enjoy the sunset.

Special thing that tour guide would like to introduce some popular authentic food in lovely mini restaurants (not luxury restaurants) where you feel comfortable to sit down and enjoy some favorite dishes and nice drinks too. It's interesting to hear from tour guide about the history of the old quarter in Hanoi, it is thousand years old and today retains much of the old flavor that made the area special in earlier times, each street was the exclusive domain of one trade (guilds) so there are whole streets of blacksmiths, silver shops, paper shops, headstone makers and more. Originally there were just 36 old streets in the old quarter but today there are more than 50 streets. It is very difficult to find some local food stalls and mini restaurants on your own in hidden alleys and sidewalks, certainly the best way to make it easy is joining with Vietnam Travel Top, taking part in this special tour to learn about Vietnamese cuisine, culture, people and language. After all. Food on Foot Tour will give you an unique experience to try the foods of the local Hanoi people, we ensure the food is handled hygienically and provide a comfortable venue for the tastings. The benefit also goes back to the vendors or restaurants/ families as we buy directly from them. At 14.30 our tour guide say goodbye to you, and will help you order taxi or show you direction back your hotel.

The Thai women are masterful weavers who ensure that there is plenty of traditional-style clothing to buy in the village centre.  You will see women weaving on looms under or inside their houses in the village We can buy some handmade traditional-style clothing, knife or cross-bow. After breakfast in home-stay, we say goodbye to villagers and leave Mai Chau around 10 am. We ride from Mai Chau to the direction of Moc Chau, where we have lunch. This highland town produces some of Vietnam’s best tea and is a good place to stock up.  The surrounding area is also home to several ethnic minorities, including Green H’mong, Dzao, Thai and Muong. Moc Chau boasts a pioneering dairy industry that started in the late 1970s with Australian (and, later, UN) assistance. The dairy provides Hanoi with such delectable iuxur us as fresh milk, sweetened condensed milk and little tooth-rotting bars called “Banh sua”.  After lunch, we turn to the less travelled Road 43 leading to the Da River, crossing the reservoir of Da river at Van Yen ferry, then ride on a beautiful winding secondary road until Bac Yen where we stay in a basic guest-house.

There is also the option for a very challenging back route which takes us through several river crossings. The massive mountain range dominates the road until finally we must make a splendid climb up from Binh Lu and up to the top of the highest road pass in Vietnam (Tram Ton Pass).  Y Ty, one of the poorest communes in Lao Cai Province’s Bat Xat District, has become an attractive tourism destination in recent years due to its natural beauty. Y Ty is still a strange name to many Vietnamese people. Nestled against 2,700m Nhi Cu San mountain, the commune rarely sees the sun and is often covered by dense white clouds. This lovely land is a must-see destination for photographers and nature lovers who dont want to be in the crowd of Sapa. Terraced fields beautifully make up the place in which tourists themselves can witness the transplanting of seedlings called “pouring water season” every May and seeing the whole area turn to green after. The sight is so astonishing that it has become a favorite shooting destination for both amateur and professional photographers.  Y Ty has become famous for its unique terraced fields made by the ethnic minority group Ha Nhi. The fields have varying terrain, but the Ha Nhi people manage to make wide and beautiful fields that amaoldPricely fit the valley curves and high mountain slopes.  Another special feature of Y Ty is its earthen houses whose architectural design is simple yet one-of-a-kind. It is mushroom-shaped especially when viewed from atop. There is only one door and a small arched window but enough to keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Though the design is basic, it takes one month to build an earthen house.
