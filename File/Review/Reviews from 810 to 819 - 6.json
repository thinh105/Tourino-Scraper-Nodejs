[{"name":"14 Days In-depth Vietnam Tour with 4-star Well Selected Hotels","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"All the excursions we went on were excellent. They provided us with a good amount of time and information for each. The tour guides were amazing. They were all very nice, welcoming and helpful. We would like to acknowledge our tour guides, Joey, in Ho Chi Minh city and Fifi in Hanoi because they were especially friendly, conversationalist, and always ready to help. They were astounding and made our trip even better. If we make this trip again, or if we recommend friends to do so, we hope they can be our tour guides again. However, we feel there were too many temples and so much information. We would have enjoyed to see less temples and have done a few different activities such as beach visits, etc. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience. Tour Radar did an amazing job in organizing the trip from the excursions, to our meals, to always providing fresh water for us, and tour guides always being on time and always ready to help us out. We would definitely use Tour Radar again, and we will surely recommend others to use Tour Radar as well. Thank you!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Everything was great a little too much temple’s for my taste but overall good, I definitely will book again and recommend"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"This was a fantastic value.

Found Ideal Travel Asia on the internet and some itineraries of my interest. I did feel a bit nervous booking directly but to me, you are great tour operator. I was shown to the best place of Vietnam where I felt in love with the beauty and tranquility of the landscape. All the rising lands in the sea, the turquoise water (not really clean though ) , mouth watering culinary and friendly people make you wish for a longr trip.

In retrospect I should have done more research Luxury Gold but I chose them based on positive past experiences with their parent company, TravelCorp.  This was not the value that I expected.￼￼￼  Our Luxury Gold tour was a shoddily-upgraded Trafalgar trip sold at twice the price."}]},{"name":"8 days explore the Northern Part of Vietnam – Ha Noi – Pu Luong – Ha Long","reviews":[{"rating":"3.5","review":"Heard a lot about Vietnam but this is the first time I’ve been here.

You will not regret it. This tour is a great way to experience Vietnam and meet new people. The people on your tour always make the trip. My tour manager on this trip really added to this holiday. Being a tour leader/ guide is more than just walking tourists around showing them the sites. Mathew James Stirland from Feel Free Travel definitely went the extra mile on my last tour with him. Mathew obviously has a love of SE Asia, and it felt like he was a local. He knew so many local people on our travels and I believe really showed us more about the culture/ home life of locals in Vietnam. We stayed in beautiful accommodation with amazing views and the relaxed family feel at some of the locals’ home stays was something I didn’t expect but really enjoyed and learnt a lot from. His knowledge of Vietnam history and current affairs added to our tours. The activities we participated in, such as exploring local markets, cooking classes with locals, biking around farms and rice fields, exploring some of Vietnams mountains, Natural wonders, National parks and temples were easily understood and undertaken by all. I’m not a great cook, but some of our meals that we were taught to cook from lovely local old women, turned out perfect and a great example of simple life skills and Vietnamese culture that we could all take home with us. �I found Mathew very easy to get along with and professional in the way he conducts his tours. Even picking me and my girlfriend up at the airport! I have no hesitation in recommending him as a tour guide for anyone, and I feel the rest of my group would say the same things."},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Had the most amazing time in Vietnam with Feel Free! :) Mat was our group leader who was extremely knowledgeable about Vietnam. I did the 15 Days and the Tour length was perfect! We spent a good amount of time in each place we went and It was so nice to relax and chill for 3 nights when we got to Hoi An. I was recommended these guys from a friend and I will definitely be recommending them myself to others. Cant wait to join them on another one of their trips as soon as I can ;)"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Most amazing experience!! At 18 I was the youngest in the group but everyone put in effort to make me feel welcome:) the group and team leaders were so so friendly, we all still remain in contact talking regularly. I also made one friend on that tour that I will never forget, and plan to do some more tours with my new travelling bestie in the future. The activities on this trip were so fun and clearly thought out, Adam, Hollie, Matt and the rest of the feel free gang put their hearts and soul into making sure you don’t miss out on a thing and really do have the trip of a lifetime:) also everything is echo friendly. BONUS. With out a shadow of doubt I’d recommend this tour company to travel with either as a group or solo, they really do make you feel part of the feel free family that they truly are:) thank you for the best time. I’ll be back exploring with you soon:)"}]}]
