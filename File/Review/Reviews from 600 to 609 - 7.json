Phnom Penh - great stay, great eating, fun traffic experiences. Sihanoukville - less than wonderful resort. Personnel fine, pool small, open bathroom a bit disconcerting - accessible to mosquitoes, wildlife etc (although we didn't experience any 'visits'). Nearby beach - although clean water - was not very visually pleasing. We visited the city of casinos, just to see; quite depressing to see the money spent there with nothing going to local infrastructure or social programs."}]},{"name":"Flavours of Vietnam","reviews":[{"rating":"3.5","review":"Began in Siem Reap - all activities in Siem Reap excellent.

The Tour Leader had exceptional knowledge on Vietnam and it's history and had also studied English for several years so was very easy to understand. Accommodation was well above what we expected and some very quaint properties we could not fault. The inclusions were amazing and we were lucky to visit over New Year which added to the experience - there were very few things that were optional which was great. Ready to do my next BackRoads Tour."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Began in Siem Reap - all activities in Siem Reap excellent. Then on to Battambang - also excellent itinerary.

We went in Ba Be Lake for kayaking and meet Tay people. It was a magical moment. The homestay was basic and comfortable. The owner were very friendly and welcoming. And then, we went in Ban Gioc area and we again feel we were in remote areas, very authentic. Ban Gioc Waterfall was amazing. Then we headed to Ha Giang - an amazing remote area with culture, local people and spectacular landscape. I could say Ha Giang is highlight of this trip - dont miss it!. Finally, we spent time in Sapa for a short trekking tour and relax. Viet - the man who contacted and took care us during our trip - was very helpfull and profestional. He almost contacted you daily to make sure everything is ok. I would highly recommend this trip!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The service was really good!
