[{"name":"4-day Pu Luong and Ninh Binh with round trip from Hanoi","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"Guides were very friendly and welcoming. Tour bus from Hanoi to port was relatively new, clean and comfortable. Boat like many others in the bay was fairly old and a bit run down. Had a great view from the top deck. The lock on our room broke and we needed to be moved to another room, the shower in the new room did not drain water so well. The tour packed in a lot of activities over the three days including a cave visit and hike up Ti Top island. Expect to pay for all drinks on the boat and corkage fee to bring your own drinks. Cat Ba island hotel was nice with a great view of the harbour and only a short walk to town. The hike included on Cat Ba was quite strenuous but the view from the top of the mountain fantastic. The trip to monkey island on a small boat off Cat Ba was cool - the monkeys can get a bit agitated, and are experts at raiding back packs, zippers pose no problem for them. Overall a lot of fun was had on the tour and it was well organised and the guides kept the group busy."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The tour was a great overview of the life and industry on the Mekong Delta. The bus was comfortable and the tour guide very knowledgeable. It was a very on the go tour and long distances made the day tiring. We did not arrive at our homestay (we chose the homestay option - there was a hotel option) until quite late. But the homestay, while at first seeming quite isolated and off the beaten track, actually had about 25 other tourists also staying there. The highlight was the cooking lesson for dinner and then eating all we had cooked. All in all, a great overview, but long distances to travel."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The tour guide and staff were excellent. The food was good. The rooms were great. Pick ups and drop offs smooth. I can say only good things about the staff. Their sense of humor and duty to their jobs was above board. The only problem I had was with how many other tours and tourists were doing the same thing at the exact same time."}]},{"name":"Trekking Experience in Sapa 4 days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"Our tour was well organized went off without a hitch .

The activities were fun and insightful and a highlight was the floating market. I felt we really saw how people on the Mekong Delta live and some Vietnamese traditions. The accommodations was basic but given the price reasonable - the home stay was very good and it was lovely speaking to a Vietnamese family. Our only surprise was how little time we actually spent travelling on the river - I had imagined that we would spend most of the time travelling to Cambodia on the river however the first two days we travelled by bus with the last day heading into Cambodia on a fast ferry for 5 hours."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"All the pick-ups were on time, both the taxies and the day trips.
