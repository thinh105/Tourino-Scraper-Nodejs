Our guide Trang (aka Peter) was excellent."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"This tour allowed us to get off the beaten track and see some parts of Vietnam that we haven't see before. This was fantastic. The long days and bad roads were definitely worth it. Our driver & guide were both fabulous. Visiting Sapa and walking around a local village was excellent but would have been better to stay in Sapa at a lodge or homestay rather than travel to Bac Ha and stay in a hotel. I would suggest that on the first day the tour should stay in Sapa - to have more free time to relax or enjoy a local restaurant and then travel to the Bac Ha markets the next day. I know it would be an early start but I think it would be worth it. The only thing we saw in Bac Ha was the markets. Pan Hou Lodge was fabulous as was the scenery along the way. Trekking on Day 4 was advertised as 4 hours but was actually all day - 8 hrs. Our family enjoyed this but it was misleading in the itinerary."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Peter was a fantastic host throughout. He was knowledgable and made us feel welcome. He went out of his way to accommodate our needs. Food was exceptional. Hotels were beautiful. He did many little extras to make our trip that little bit more special"}]},{"name":"Hanoi at Glance for Full Day Trip plus Mai Chau Valley","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"Excellent -everything was really well organised from airport pickups, trips, hotels, food & guides."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Full intinerary, opportunity to see so many things.
