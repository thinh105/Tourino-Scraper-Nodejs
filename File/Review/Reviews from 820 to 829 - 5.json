You will not regret it. This tour is a great way to experience Vietnam and meet new people.\nThe people on your tour always make the trip. My tour manager on this trip really added to this holiday. \nBeing a tour leader/ guide is more than just walking tourists around showing them the sites. Mathew James Stirland from Feel Free Travel definitely went the extra mile on my last tour with him. Mathew obviously has a love of SE Asia, and it felt like he was a local. He knew so many local people on our travels and I believe really showed us more about the culture/ home life of locals in Vietnam. We stayed in beautiful accommodation with amazing views and the relaxed family feel at some of the locals’ home stays was something I didn’t expect but really enjoyed and learnt a lot from. His knowledge of Vietnam history and current affairs added to our tours. The activities we participated in, such as exploring local markets, cooking classes with locals, biking around farms and rice fields, exploring some of Vietnams mountains, Natural wonders, National parks and temples were easily understood and undertaken by all. I’m not a great cook, but some of our meals that we were taught to cook from lovely local old women, turned out perfect and a great example of simple life skills and Vietnamese culture that we could all take home with us. �I found Mathew very easy to get along with and professional in the way he conducts his tours. Even picking me and my girlfriend up at the airport! I have no hesitation in recommending him as a tour guide for anyone, and I feel the rest of my group would say the same things."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Had the most amazing time in Vietnam with Feel Free! :) Mat was our group leader who was extremely knowledgeable about Vietnam. I did the 15 Days and the Tour length was perfect! We spent a good amount of time in each place we went and It was so nice to relax and chill for 3 nights when we got to Hoi An. \nI was recommended these guys from a friend and I will definitely be recommending them myself to others. Cant wait to join them on another one of their trips as soon as I can ;)"}]},{"name":"Tour 9 days Ha Noi – Sapa – Ha Long","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Heard a lot about Vietnam but this is the first time I’ve been here. Found Ideal Travel Asia on the internet and some itineraries of my interest. I did feel a bit nervous booking directly but to me, you are great tour operator. I was shown to the best place of Vietnam where I felt in love with the beauty and tranquility of the landscape. All the rising lands in the sea, the turquoise water (not really clean though ) , mouth watering culinary and friendly people make you wish for a longr trip. I think I would come back here one more time, with Ideal Travel Asia of course. Thank your for everything."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Hi Mai. Thank you for all! That was amazing experience!

The hotel was very comfortable and food was good. Would recommend this tour."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"The trip went very well. Everything was organised so well and we did not have any problems. It was so easy to book with Tour Radar. I was reluctant to book directly with a Vietnamese tour agents since communication might be delayed and also I might be cheated. Tour Radar had a 24 hours contact number which is based in Australia and that was so helpful. I also like how you can communicate with the Tour Radar's Vietnamese tour agent directly from Tour Radar's email. My overall rating is 5/5. Looking forward to booking my next trip with Tour Radar."}]},{"name":"Family Vietnam In Depth","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"Don't go to Phu Coc in August \nBasicalli it us shut down !!!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Full on tour seeing the diversity of the country and touching on some of the history. Good mix of adult and children’s activities suggested age in my opinion from 12+ yrs. Would always take up option of extra days at the end of the tour however would check on what season it is before going with Phu Quoc maybe Explore could offer and additional option."},{"rating":"4.3","review":"had to pay to extend room in Phu Quoc\nItinery is great, suggestions would be to change the Halong Bay experience, it was very touristy and out of kilter with the rest of the trip, dont do a cyclo trip in Ho Chi Min - Hanoi much better; in Ho Chi Min show the option for a visit to the war museum.."},{"rating":"4.7","review":"This is our fourth Explore family holiday and lived up to expectations"}]}]
