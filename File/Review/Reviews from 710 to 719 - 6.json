Communication was impeccable all through the trip with notable flexibility from the organizers' side. The only down-side of this trip in specific is the daily commuting and transportation - we were almost on the move every single day. Other than that everything went smooth and up to our expectations - would totally deal with ATP again and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"It was a good experience for my Vietnam trip. They followed everything from start to finish. It made my vacation worry free, thanks to Asia Pacific travel,(Mrs BAO)she what’s app me every night, make sure I don’t get lost. The local tour guide is good,knowledgeable. They are ten out of ten, I highly recommend APT,"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"The places I went during these 5 days were incredible. I felt the staff and management of the tour were exceptional. The hotel was good and clean, staff were friendly and the accommodation on the boat was amazing. I loved waking up in Halong bay to the sunrise as a start to my day. As a solo traveler with only a short time in Vietnam, I feel this was the best way for me to see these incredible parts of Vietnam. This made the long bus rides and average food worth it to me. At the end of my tour I was greeted by one of the supervisors and she checked in with me about my trip. She even gave me a little farewell token. I feel that the communication and people with this travel group were professional and really amazing. Overall, I do recommend this trip, just don't forget your neck pillow and extra waters for the bus rides ;)."}]}]
