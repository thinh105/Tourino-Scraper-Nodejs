Perhaps a day for testing is a good idea as someone has already suggested. Enjoyed Sapa 2days excursion. Our guide Lee was excellent. Very good English (best of every guide) and very informative about district and Vietnamese culture. Good train journeys. The day from Hue to Quang Bihn Paradise cave was too long and we would have preferred to visit DMZ Zone and Vihn Moc Tunnels instead. Bit disappointed at 4 Isand trip from NhaTrang. Only 1 beach with good sand. Most things went to plan. Left a couple of times wondering if pick up would arrive but a quick message to Ms Lan and everything was sorted. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Most 10 day tour was good. The train journey shocked us.

The first was into the Northern Vietnam countryside to the Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be Lake. What an amazing adventure and insight into the daily lives of the local people. The home stays were absolutely incredible and something we will never forget. Long was a fantastic tour guide. The second was a cruise to Halong Bay. This is a must see for anyone traveling in Northern Vietnam. Incredible scenery and a wonderful overnight cruise. Our tour guide Lang spoke excellent English, was so well organized, and made sure everyone’s needs were met. The common thread was the welcoming, friendly nature of the Vietnamese people. There is A LOT of driving, but that is required to get to remote places. It was an outstanding value and I would highly recommend both tours."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Had a wonderful time visiting the remote Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be National Park. The homestays were fun and we bonded well with the other tour group members. The only minor gripe was the long bus journeys in between which took up much of the tour."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Do it!
