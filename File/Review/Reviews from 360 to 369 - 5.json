We booked the 16 days tour Vietnam and Cambodia through Tour Radar and were well taken care of from the beginning to the end. When we arrived Hanoi, Vietnam, Chloe came to our hotel and gave us every documents needed. She also provided us a local SIM that we used to contact her easily. Well, everything was very good from hotels, cruise tour to transportation daily and road tours. We highly recommend Vietnam Allure Travel"}]},{"name":"Classis Sai Gon 6 Days 5 Nights","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"The tour was very well organised from start to finish with clear instructions and seem less transfers between activities. The activities were fun and insightful and a highlight was the floating market. I felt we really saw how people on the Mekong Delta live and some Vietnamese traditions. The accommodations was basic but given the price reasonable - the home stay was very good and it was lovely speaking to a Vietnamese family. Our only surprise was how little time we actually spent travelling on the river - I had imagined that we would spend most of the time travelling to Cambodia on the river however the first two days we travelled by bus with the last day heading into Cambodia on a fast ferry for 5 hours."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"All the pick-ups were on time, both the taxies and the day trips.

Found Ideal Travel Asia on the internet and some itineraries of my interest. I did feel a bit nervous booking directly but to me, you are great tour operator. I was shown to the best place of Vietnam where I felt in love with the beauty and tranquility of the landscape. All the rising lands in the sea, the turquoise water (not really clean though ) , mouth watering culinary and friendly people make you wish for a longr trip. I think I would come back here one more time, with Ideal Travel Asia of course. Thank your for everything."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Hi Mai. Thank you for all! That was amazing experience!
