[{"name":"Hanoi And Red River Delta 8 days 7 nights","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"We had two different tours which were totally different, and each excellent. The first was into the Northern Vietnam countryside to the Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be Lake. What an amazing adventure and insight into the daily lives of the local people. The home stays were absolutely incredible and something we will never forget. Long was a fantastic tour guide. The second was a cruise to Halong Bay. This is a must see for anyone traveling in Northern Vietnam. Incredible scenery and a wonderful overnight cruise. Our tour guide Lang spoke excellent English, was so well organized, and made sure everyone’s needs were met. The common thread was the welcoming, friendly nature of the Vietnamese people. There is A LOT of driving, but that is required to get to remote places. It was an outstanding value and I would highly recommend both tours."},{"rating":"3.5","review":"Had a wonderful time visiting the remote Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be National Park. The homestays were fun and we bonded well with the other tour group members. The only minor gripe was the long bus journeys in between which took up much of the tour."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Do it!

We booked the 16 days tour Vietnam and Cambodia through Tour Radar and were well taken care of from the beginning to the end. When we arrived Hanoi, Vietnam, Chloe came to our hotel and gave us every documents needed. She also provided us a local SIM that we used to contact her easily. Well, everything was very good from hotels, cruise tour to transportation daily and road tours. We highly recommend Vietnam Allure Travel"}]},{"name":"Hightlight Vietnam 7 Days 6 Nights (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City)","reviews":[{"rating":"4.0","review":"The tour was very well organised from start to finish with clear instructions and seem less transfers between activities. The activities were fun and insightful and a highlight was the floating market. I felt we really saw how people on the Mekong Delta live and some Vietnamese traditions. The accommodations was basic but given the price reasonable - the home stay was very good and it was lovely speaking to a Vietnamese family. Our only surprise was how little time we actually spent travelling on the river - I had imagined that we would spend most of the time travelling to Cambodia on the river however the first two days we travelled by bus with the last day heading into Cambodia on a fast ferry for 5 hours."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"All the pick-ups were on time, both the taxies and the day trips.

Communication was impeccable all through the trip with notable flexibility from the organizers' side. The only down-side of this trip in specific is the daily commuting and transportation - we were almost on the move every single day. Other than that everything went smooth and up to our expectations - would totally deal with ATP again and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"It was a good experience for my Vietnam trip. They followed everything from start to finish. It made my vacation worry free, thanks to Asia Pacific travel,(Mrs BAO)she what’s app me every night, make sure I don’t get lost. The local tour guide is good,knowledgeable. They are ten out of ten, I highly recommend APT,"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"The places I went during these 5 days were incredible. I felt the staff and management of the tour were exceptional. The hotel was good and clean, staff were friendly and the accommodation on the boat was amazing. I loved waking up in Halong bay to the sunrise as a start to my day. As a solo traveler with only a short time in Vietnam, I feel this was the best way for me to see these incredible parts of Vietnam. This made the long bus rides and average food worth it to me. At the end of my tour I was greeted by one of the supervisors and she checked in with me about my trip. She even gave me a little farewell token. I feel that the communication and people with this travel group were professional and really amazing. Overall, I do recommend this trip, just don't forget your neck pillow and extra waters for the bus rides ;)."}]}]
