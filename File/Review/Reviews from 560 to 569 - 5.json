[{"name":"8 Days Best Vietnam North to South Tour, Max 6 Guests","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"All the excursions we went on were excellent. They provided us with a good amount of time and information for each. The tour guides were amazing. They were all very nice, welcoming and helpful. We would like to acknowledge our tour guides, Joey, in Ho Chi Minh city and Fifi in Hanoi because they were especially friendly, conversationalist, and always ready to help. They were astounding and made our trip even better. If we make this trip again, or if we recommend friends to do so, we hope they can be our tour guides again. However, we feel there were too many temples and so much information. We would have enjoyed to see less temples and have done a few different activities such as beach visits, etc. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience. Tour Radar did an amazing job in organizing the trip from the excursions, to our meals, to always providing fresh water for us, and tour guides always being on time and always ready to help us out. We would definitely use Tour Radar again, and we will surely recommend others to use Tour Radar as well. Thank you!"},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Everything was great a little too much templeâ€™s for my taste but overall good, I definitely will book again and recommend"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This was a fantastic value.

We booked the 16 days tour Vietnam and Cambodia through Tour Radar and were well taken care of from the beginning to the end. When we arrived Hanoi, Vietnam, Chloe came to our hotel and gave us every documents needed. She also provided us a local SIM that we used to contact her easily. Well, everything was very good from hotels, cruise tour to transportation daily and road tours. We highly recommend Vietnam Allure Travel"}]}]
