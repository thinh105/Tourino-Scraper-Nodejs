[{"name":"Best of North Vietnam - 7 days","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"We heard about Northern Vietnam is the most peaceful area in the country. So we decided to spend our vacation with this 8-day trip and Crossing Vietnam Tour who earned a number of positive feedbacks was our last option. We just had to pack our belongings and be taken care by the company. All of the highlights were shown in the tour. We had Alex as the guide and his english was beyond our expectations. \nHighly recommend"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"We did a seven day tour with Vietnam crossing including Hanoi, Sapa and Halong Bay!\nEverything was like clock work. All pick ups on time and all the hotels were good and we upgraded in one to get a junior suite. Alice was always available and very helpful. The street food tour with Alice was also a lot of fun. The only negative was our guide in Sapa who was not informative. Thank you Alice and Vietnam Crossing!"},{"rating":"5.0","review":"This was a great way fr us to see ad experience some wonderful parts of Vietnam in 7 days ,we had and almost no time to do our own planning, Lucy was great in working with our schedule and just overall communication It was really well planned and all our guides were very well knowledgeable. Even when there were small issues, Lucy was very quick to resolve them and give alternatives. We had a great time and the highlights for us were definitely Halong-bay Cruise, Ninh Binh, and overnight train to Sapa and the whole Sapa experience. We will talk about this trip for a while. Thanks Lucy and Thanks best price travel. If you are debating it, do it and go with the flow, be flexible and just enjoy your time."}]},{"name":"Highlight northern Vietnam Tour 7 days/6 nights","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"We had a private tour for just 2 of us.

Abraham was so thorough and extremely friendly. Kudos Abraham :) Transportation was also included straight from our gorgeous hotel which was included in the tour to Ha Long Bay. Another awesome part of the tour was the food tour that Abraham brought us to. The food tour was fascinating and he brought us to a local coffee shop which served the best Vietnamese Coffee I've ever had on my Vietnamese trip with a reasonable price. It's worth every single penny.  Highly recommended to everybody :)"}]},{"name":"8 Days Immersed In The Beauty Of Northern Vietnam","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"This is an amazing tour.

Local food tour in many hidden gems in Hanoi was a thoughtful greeting from the company. After a great night a hotel, we were able to discover more history and visiting places in this capital with a local guide. After enjoying 1 night on the cruise in Halong bay and Pearl farm, we did sleeper train to Sapa where we were capable to learn about ethnics lifestyle and explore more pastoral scenery. I am willing to recommend this company for everybody"}]},{"name":"Scenic Saigon Motorcycle Tour to Nha Trang via Mui Ne and Da Lat, Bao Loc","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Me and a friend went into this trip without a clue what to expect.
