[{"name":"3 DAYS IMMERSE IN NATURAL THUNG NHAM BIRD PARK, TRANG AN AND CUC PHUONG NATIONAL PARK","reviews":[{"rating":"3.5","review":"Heard a lot about Vietnam but this is the first time Iâ€™ve been here. Found Ideal Travel Asia on the internet and some itineraries of my interest. I did feel a bit nervous booking directly but to me, you are great tour operator. I was shown to the best place of Vietnam where I felt in love with the beauty and tranquility of the landscape. All the rising lands in the sea, the turquoise water (not really clean though ) , mouth watering culinary and friendly people make you wish for a longr trip. I think I would come back here one more time, with Ideal Travel Asia of course. Thank your for everything."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Hi Mai. Thank you for all! That was amazing experience!

Good mix of busy days and relaxing days"}]},{"name":"Vietnam Discovery 22 days & 21 nights","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"The tour was very well organised from start to finish with clear instructions and seem less transfers between activities. The activities were fun and insightful and a highlight was the floating market. I felt we really saw how people on the Mekong Delta live and some Vietnamese traditions. The accommodations was basic but given the price reasonable - the home stay was very good and it was lovely speaking to a Vietnamese family. Our only surprise was how little time we actually spent travelling on the river - I had imagined that we would spend most of the time travelling to Cambodia on the river however the first two days we travelled by bus with the last day heading into Cambodia on a fast ferry for 5 hours."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"All the pick-ups were on time, both the taxies and the day trips.

Bac and Pure Travel know what they are doing, are very knowledgeable, friendly and willing to take their time to make sure my time in Hanoi was great."}]},{"name":"Vietnam Highlight Tour with some biking - 21 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"4.5","review":"Excellent -everything was really well organised from airport pickups, trips, hotels, food & guides."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Full intinerary, opportunity to see so many things. Very little down time. Excellent organization of tours, pick ups, flights, etc. Very attentive to travellers needs. Would travel with legend tours again. Thank you for an excellent trip."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"A diverse & vibrant tour - fantastic food - knowledgable guides - a holiday to remember"}]},{"name":"Vietnam Heritage by Bicycle","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Our family of 5 enjoyed the Halong Bay 3-day bike trip. It was a nice way to see the area -- better than just viewing from a car window. Great guides!"},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Shame on me! We should have brought our own bikes! between us we own 9 bikes and would have had no problem as to cost or expense but the logistics prevented bringing our own. bikes were 4-6 years old, not properly maintained, for example no rear brakes, chain \"jumping\" when shifting. We felt bad for our guide who also was an excellent mechanic but due to lack of support from Spice Roads he did as good as can be expected. Unless you bring you own bike or just go for a day ride, I would seriously suggest that you shop around."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Fantastic tour, with extremely diverse sights -- from the beaches of Central Vietnam to the temples of Angkor Wat. We particularly enjoyed the hill country of Vietnam (the climbing day was excellent) as well as the temple sites in Cambodia. The accommodations were generally no-frills (due, in part, to the remote locations we were traveling through), though the hotel in Angkor Wat was excellent. The meals were fantastic -- the guides did an excellent job of selecting restaurants with great local fare. Would definitely recommend."}]}]
