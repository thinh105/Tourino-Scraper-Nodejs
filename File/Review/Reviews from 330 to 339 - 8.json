The activities were fun and insightful and a highlight was the floating market. I felt we really saw how people on the Mekong Delta live and some Vietnamese traditions. The accommodations was basic but given the price reasonable - the home stay was very good and it was lovely speaking to a Vietnamese family. Our only surprise was how little time we actually spent travelling on the river - I had imagined that we would spend most of the time travelling to Cambodia on the river however the first two days we travelled by bus with the last day heading into Cambodia on a fast ferry for 5 hours."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"All the pick-ups were on time, both the taxies and the day trips.

The places were beautiful. Tam coc felt more personal than halong bay. The guide, Kevin, was very good. He interacted with his \"charges\" and even gave us a rendition of a typical Vietnamese love song. He even sang at the end of the tour, in Russian and French. Lunch was provide in buffet style and of very good choice and quality.\nWould recommend Vietnam Travel Top highly."}]},{"name":"Hanoi - Glory Legend Cruises plus Mountain Retreat 7 Days","reviews":[{"rating":"5.0","review":"Excellent -everything was really well organised from airport pickups, trips, hotels, food & guides."},{"rating":"4.0","review":"Full intinerary, opportunity to see so many things.
