The first was into the Northern Vietnam countryside to the Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be Lake. What an amazing adventure and insight into the daily lives of the local people. The home stays were absolutely incredible and something we will never forget. Long was a fantastic tour guide. The second was a cruise to Halong Bay. This is a must see for anyone traveling in Northern Vietnam. Incredible scenery and a wonderful overnight cruise. Our tour guide Lang spoke excellent English, was so well organized, and made sure everyoneâ€™s needs were met. The common thread was the welcoming, friendly nature of the Vietnamese people. There is A LOT of driving, but that is required to get to remote places. It was an outstanding value and I would highly recommend both tours."},{"rating":"4.5","review":"Had a wonderful time visiting the remote Ban Gioc Waterfall and Ba Be National Park. The homestays were fun and we bonded well with the other tour group members. The only minor gripe was the long bus journeys in between which took up much of the tour."},{"rating":"5.0","review":"Do it! Great tour, very authentic."}]}]
